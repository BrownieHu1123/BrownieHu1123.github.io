           <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <p>Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II.</p>
           <p>An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship.</p>
           <p>His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed.</p>
           <p>Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and its subsequent successors the EC and the EU.</p>
           <p> It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. </p>
           <p>Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy and the more prosperous north.</p>
